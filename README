This color scheme is based upon Panos Laganakos' original darktango vimscript #1672 color scheme.
I have improved upon the original scheme by increasing the number of colors used to disambiguate different sytactical structures.  With one exception, the scheme is restricted to colors from the Tango Icon palette
